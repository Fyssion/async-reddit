An async API wrapper for read-only Reddit written in Python

## Motivation

I wanted a simple and easy-to-use async API wrapper for Reddit's read-only API,
written in python.

The other Reddit API wrappers out there either weren't async, weren't finished, 
or weren't completely documented. I also wanted to be able to access Reddit
without providing login information, as well as builtin discord.py integration.

So async-reddit was born.

## Installation

Install with your favorite variant of the below:

```bash
pip install async-reddit
```

## Documentation

Documentation can be found [here.](https://async-reddit.readthedocs.io)
